- `CustomerID`: Unique ID for each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned by the store (1 to 100)

## Requirements

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using pip:
